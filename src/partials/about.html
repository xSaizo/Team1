      Ice cream is a frozen dessert, typically made from milk or cream and
      flavoured with a sweetener, either sugar or an alternative, and a spice,
      such as cocoa or vanilla, or with fruit such as strawberries or peaches.
      It can also be made by whisking a flavored cream base and liquid nitrogen
      together. Food coloring is sometimes added, in addition to stabilizers.
      The mixture is cooled below the freezing point of water and stirred to
      incorporate air spaces and to prevent detectable ice crystals from
      forming. The result is a smooth, semi-solid foam that is solid at very low
      temperatures (below 2 °C or 35 °F). It becomes more malleable as its
      temperature increases. The meaning of the name "ice cream" varies from one
      country to another. In some countries, such as the United States, "ice
      cream" applies only to a specific variety, and most governments regulate
      the commercial use of the various terms according to the relative
      quantities of the main ingredients, notably the amount of cream. Products
      that do not meet the criteria to be called ice cream are sometimes
      labelled "frozen dairy dessert" instead. In other countries, such as Italy
      and Argentina, one word is used for all variants. Analogues made from
      dairy alternatives, such as goat's or sheep's milk, or milk substitutes
      (e.g., soy, cashew, coconut, almond milk or tofu), are available for those
      who are lactose intolerant, allergic to dairy protein or vegan. Ice cream
      may be served in dishes, for eating with a spoon, or licked from edible
      wafer cones. Ice cream may be served with other desserts—such as apple
      pie, or as an ingredient in ice cream floats, sundaes, milkshakes, ice
      cream cakes and baked items, such as Baked Alaska.
